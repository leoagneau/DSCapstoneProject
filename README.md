NLP Capstone Project for Data Science Specialization by Coursera 

This is the source code of the Shiny app [Next Word Prediction (NEWPRE)](https://leomak.shinyapps.io/textprediction/).

The program needs `app.R` and `helpers.R` to run.  `Load_txt_Create_FreqRDS.R` and `Load_txt_Create_FreqRDS_all.R` are files to generate necessary corpora for Good-Turing discounting model and Katz Backoff N-gram algorithm to run on.

A introductory presentation slides can be found [here](http://rpubs.com/leomak/Next_Word_Prediction_NEWPRE).
